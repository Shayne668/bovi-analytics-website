# Public website for the Bovi-Analytics lab

[Miel Hostens](https://www.bovi-analytics.com/) • Faculty of Veterinary
Medicine • Utrecht University

## How to build the site

1.  Install
    [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
    version 2022.07.1 or later since it has a
    [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) installation embedded in it.
    Otherwise, download and install [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)
    separately.
2.  Open `bovi-analytics.Rproj` to open an [RStudio
    Project](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html).
3.  If it’s not installed already, R *should* try to install the [{renv}
    package](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) when you open the RStudio
    Project for the first time. If you don’t see a message about package
    installation, install it yourself by running
    `install.packages("renv")` in the R console.
4.  Run `renv::restore()` in the R console to install all the required
    packages for this project.
5.  🎉 All done! 🎉 The complete website will be in a folder named
    `_site/`.

The pipeline does major tasks:

- **Build Quarto website**: This project is a [Quarto
  website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), which compiles and
  stitches together all the `.qmd` files in this project based on the
  settings in [`_quarto.yml`](_quarto.yml). See the [Quarto website
  documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) for more details.

- **Upload resulting `_site/` folder to github pages**: This project is
  published using github pages using the
  `quarto publish gh-pages --no-browser` command
